# 🍴 Restaurant Web Project  
### Crafted with care by **Aastha Rajput**

## 🌟 About the Project  
This is my version of a **Django-based Restaurant Management Web Application**.  
I built it to explore how a real restaurant website works — from menu display to table booking and order handling — all in one place.

The project lets:
- Customers browse the restaurant’s menu 🍕  
- Place food orders online 🍔  
- Book a table for a specific time 🕒  
- And allows the admin to manage everything easily through Django’s admin panel ⚙️  

It’s a clean, simple, and functional web app — perfect for learning or demonstrating full-stack web development skills.
